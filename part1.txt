  The year is 2917. Earth has long since become inhabitable and mankind 
       has been forced to the stars and colonised the solar system. 
 Many of humanities needs are controlled by interplanetary corporations. 
  One such organisation, Bradfield-Solaris Resources, operates numerous 
mining operations within the asteroid belt from its regional headquarters 
  on Ceres to gather precious materials to be exported to the colonies.
