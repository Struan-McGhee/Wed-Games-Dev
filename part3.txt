      It was on one such trip your parents where beset upon by
    Vendikar corsairs, and taken to the mines of Asteroid NW-D14. 
 It was here you were born into a life of slavery like so many others.
     From an early age, you dreamed of a life outside the mines. 
      Over the years, you would often craft schemes to escape, 
but it was not till you were certified to operate the bipedal excavator 
 in the Level 4 shafts that you could final put your plans into action. 
                    It is time to make your break for freedom!
