 However, unknown to the general populous of the colonies, BSR is exploiting
       the lawlessness of space to use slave labour in their facilities. They 
 have a secret partnership with the Vendikar Syndicate, a pirate organisation 
terrorising the moons of Jupiter to capture unsuspecting space farers as they
 make the journey from the Martian Citadels to the Saturnian Pleasure Barges.
